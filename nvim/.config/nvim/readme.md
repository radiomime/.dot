# overview

A general place for useful notes regarding my neovim config.

## linting

```
:Lspinstall <language>
```

## formatting

- I use null-ls for formatting, and the formatters should be natively executable commands.

## Plugins

### Alternatives

- nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim
  - instead of nvim-tree. this should have fewer breaking changes and have some
    other features. currently I don't think it seems much better.
